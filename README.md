## About OntoME

OntoME is a software as a service (SaaS) that offers research projects the ability of managing their ontologies in a collaborative and open way. OntoME is mainly developed by the Digital history research team at the [LARHRA lab](https://larhra.fr) (CNRS â€“ universities of Lyon and Grenoble), as part of the Geovistory ecosystem.

Geovistory furthermore consists of an active [community](https://www.geovistory.org/community) , which constantly develops and documents its components.
You are invite to join our efforts. Meet us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pjcwjnruVb)

OntoME is not distributed, the application is only accessible at https://ontome.net. It is a unique, community-managed place to design ontologies and application profiles.
